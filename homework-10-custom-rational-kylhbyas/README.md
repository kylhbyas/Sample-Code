## Required Files
* Makefile
  * Controls compilation and cleans temporary and extraneous files.

* Rational.h
  * Declares the Rational class.

* Rational.cpp
  * Contains the definitions of the methods for the Rational class.

* main.cpp
  * Contains the main function and interacts with the user.

## Compilation Instructions
How do we compile your program?
* To compile type <make> which calls the Makefile.

## Program usage
How do we run your program?  Does it expect any inputs?
* To run the program type <make> to compile and make the executable then type <./rational> to run the executable.

* The program will prompt the user for a character input corresponding to a selection of operations. Then the program will prompt the user for 2 or more integers to make one or more rational numbers and then perfom the selected operation on the user defined rational number(s).

## Notes
Any extra notes, such as:
* What is working?
  * Almost the entire program is working as intended.

* What are the limitations of your program?
  * Only select operations are implemented.
  * Assignment is not behaving correctly.

* What design decisions did you make?
  * Consistency was the primary consideration at the time of writing.
